# Acoustic Metamaterials Group Project
 
## Reviews

This is a long review on metamaterials that Dr. Haberman co-wrote. The references are extensive: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-020-0206-0

## Possible topics

Here is a physics-y paper that applies the quantum mechanical phenomenon of the [Dirac cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_cone) to acoustics: [Observation of acoustic Dirac-like cone and double
zero refractive index](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.gatech.edu/dist/0/833/files/2018/09/Observation-of-acoustic-Dirac-like-cone-and-double.pdf)


This is an interesting biomedical application of acoustic metamaterials--we could try replicating the finite element models: [Non-Hermitian complementary acoustic
metamaterials for lossy barriers](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.gatech.edu/dist/0/833/files/2019/07/Non-Hermitian-complementary-acoustic-metamaterials-for-lossy-barriers.pdf)
