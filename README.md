# Acoustic Metamaterials Group Project
 
## Topic

Using finite element methods, we will replicate a metamaterial that features a "[Dirac cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_cone)," a point at which the compressibility and the density are simultaneously zero (a so-called "double -zero" metamaterial). 

We will replicate the results described in this paper: [Observation of acoustic Dirac-like cone and double
zero refractive index](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.gatech.edu/dist/0/833/files/2018/09/Observation-of-acoustic-Dirac-like-cone-and-double.pdf) (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14871#Sec11) for supplementary information)



## Work distribution
Chirag will write the introduction and discussion, which will draw parallels between quantum mechanics and acoustics. Chirag will derive the dispersion relation and numerically find the frequency at which the metamaterial hosts double-zero properties. Chirag will also discuss the potential applications of this technology.

Ryan will model the metamaterial's physical structure in SolidWorks and import the model into COMSOL. 

Ryan and Akash will run the simulations in COMSOL. Ryan and Akash will calculatre the transmission coefficient at a range of frequencies and compare to figure 2f in the paper. Ryan and Akash will replicate the Dirac cone structure at various frequencies and compare to figure 4a. 

Ryan will explore the manufacturing limitations/errors involved in production and determine a range of errors under which the Dirac cone can still be observed.


## Project report
We will write the memo and report in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/8569867689cdpfgzhjqvpq)

## Other possibilities

If this project does not work out...

This is a nice [review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-020-0206-0) on metamaterials that Dr. Haberman co-wrote. The references are extensive. 

This is an interesting biomedical application of acoustic metamaterials--we could try replicating the finite element models: [Non-Hermitian complementary acoustic
metamaterials for lossy barriers](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.gatech.edu/dist/0/833/files/2019/07/Non-Hermitian-complementary-acoustic-metamaterials-for-lossy-barriers.pdf)
